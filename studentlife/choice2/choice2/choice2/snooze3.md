## You choose to sleep, again

This time you fall into a deep sleep and didn't know that the alarm clock already stopped ringing.  
When you finally felt that you have enough sleep you woke up, and see yourself on the bed.  
You look down at yourself (the self that is looking at the one on the bed), you see yourself being transparent. Then it dawn on you, you are dead.
