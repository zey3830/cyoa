## You choose to take your time

As you slowly get out of your bed and wash up in the bathroom, you went down stairs and saw your mom making breakfast. As she set down the breakfast you took your time eating, but your mom told you to eat faster and don't be late for school. You ignored her and soon realized its already 7:45 am and school starts at 8 am.
