### You decided to spend your time playing video games....

Wow, you spent most of your time grinding on the game that you got really good at it. And it only took a few months of eating cup noodles as your 3 meals. You got really good at the game and the pros took notice of that, which made them decide to recruit you! You are now a professional player and are rich.
