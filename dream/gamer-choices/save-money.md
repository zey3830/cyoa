### You chose to save money for "future use"!

Look, saving money is a good thing. It helps you keep track of how much you are using. However, who would've thought saving all that money would get your account targeted by people. You get real mad that all your hard work has gone to waste, so you go to the police. They tell you that they are on the case and you will have to wait for about 3 months.

You sit down back at home and continue wait for the next 3 months in excitement for the robber to be taken down...
